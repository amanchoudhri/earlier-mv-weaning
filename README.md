# Effects of Aggressive and Conservative Strategies for Mechanical Ventilation Liberation

Recently published in the Journal of Critical Care! Available [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2023.154275).

A project using causal inference to help physicians better understand the process of weaning ICU patients off of mechanical ventilation, mentored by [Zach Shahn](https://sph.cuny.edu/about/people/faculty/zach-shahn/), [Elias Baedorf-Kassis](https://www.pulmonaryfellowship.hms.harvard.edu/elias-baedorf-kassis-md), and [Li-wei Lehman](http://web.mit.edu/lilehman/www/).

Specifically, we've used a technique known as incremental propensity score intervention [(Kennedy, 2018)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00211.pdf) to estimate how varying liberation strategies for ICU patients on mechanical ventilation affects outcomes like mortality and ventilator-free days.
