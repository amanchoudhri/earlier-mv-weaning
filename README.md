# Effects of Aggressive and Conservative Strategies for Mechanical Ventilation Liberation
A project using causal inference to help physicians better understand the process of weaning ICU patients off of mechanical ventilation.

Specifically, we're using a technique known as incremental propensity score intervention [(Kennedy, 2018)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00211.pdf) to estimate how varying liberation strategies for ICU patients on mechanical ventilation affects outcomes like mortality and ventilator-free days.
